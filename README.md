## Hello, welcome.

Thanks for stopping by. Here's a bit about me:

- I enjoy learning and gaining new experiences.
- I'm curious by nature. I like to solve problems and hone my skills.
- Unix-like operating systems and the command-line are my home.
- I like to build things, but I also find it thrilling to study and
  break them (ethical/white hat hacking).
- It's important to me that I understand how and why something works.
